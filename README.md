# Pewlett-Hackard-Challenge
## Module 7: SQL

## Overview and Purpose

The managers at Pewlett Hackard, a large corporation would like to make assumptions on the future of the work force. They need our assistance in determining how many open roles are needed to be filled in future years as well as how many employees in each department are set to retire soon. Since the company is indeed very large, it is crucial to determine how impactful the next round of retirements will be and if they need to ramp up new hires to match that. This is where our analysis comes into play and using SQL to sift through the thousands of employees at this prestigious firm comes in handy. Some of the analysis conducted are the following:

- Determine the number of retiring employees per title.
- Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results

### Determine the number of retiring employees per title: Attached is a screenshot of the breakdown per title of the number of employees eligible for retirement at Pewlett Hackard. A few conclusions can be made and are listed below.

- A stand out statistic is that only 2 managers are in the retirement range, which is good. This means they do not have a problem with this role of manager, potentially they could hire managers and promote them as senior staff since there are 28,854 Senior Staff in the red zone.
- There is a clear and obvious cause for concern at Pewlett Hackard. An astounding number of senior engineers and engineers are reaching the end of their careers and will be retiring. from the total employees eligible for retirement, 1761 Assistant Engineers, 12243 Engineers and a massive 29419 Senior Engineers make a large majority of employees on the brink of retirement, almost 45,397 engineers could leave Pewlett Hackard! Which means they must start looking at filling these roles or promoting people from the company already, even senior staff need to be replaced from within. 
- The table above shows the serious level of problem at this company, of the 90 thousand employees at Pewlett Hackard, the total employees of retirement age are 58,000, divided the total it comes to almost 65% of the workforce.

### Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program: Attached is a screenshot of the breakdown per title of the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program at Pewlett Hackard. A few conclusions can be made and are listed below.

- The mentorship program is available for a total of 1549 employees, these have been listed in the data output we have created for the company.
- Of the 1549 employees, 314 are either senior engineers or senior staff.

## Summary

### The Silver Tsunami

- 90,398 Employees roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact. 

### The mentorship programs

- There are 1549 total employees in the mentorship program, 314 of which are senior engineers or staff, but this is a low number compared the total. This indicates there is not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. The mentorship program is not enough to help out in the 'silver tsunami' the company is facing.

### Additional Ideas

1. Hiring from within is crucial and good training, another thing we could do with a new query is lower the age of mentorship eligibility so that it is less stringent and allows more people to fit the criteria.
2. The company should consider hiring from outside aggressively, other insights that could be made from further analysis and queries could be to compare past years retirement rates and see how many people of the actual eligible to retire in that given year. That way the company can have a yield expected of how many employees they will lose and can hire accordingly.
